# Areas for improvements


# Logging 
 We need to implement the logging to help to answer these needs:
 - Monitoring
 - Support
# Security

## Authorization
- API Key
- API Token (with Authenticate API)

## Data Encryption
We need to implement the data encryption in both use cases:
- At Rest
- In Transit

# CICD

## Infrastructure-as-code
Need to implement the infrastructure-as-code.
With the efficient CICD and the infrastructure-as-code, we could shorter the time to market (from development to production) and restore in the case of fail-over.
## CICD Pipelines
Need to have the complete CICD

# API 
We need to improve the API documentation to help the merchants could implement more pre-check, tests in their solution before sending requests to Payment Gateway. It could help the excellence operational to customers.
There are three areas for improvements:

- Example
- Metadata
- Automation Testings (Postman)
